# Uniclop #

_This project is on its initial ([non functional](RoadMap.md)) phase (started on May 2009)_

This project attempts to create an easy to use online self calibration software.

To do so it will provide, as a spin-off result an online monocular visual odometry/a simple monocular visual slam.

This project will reuse as much existing code as possible and release the result in a package as easy to use as possible.


## for you ##
(fun 3d reconstruction using your webcam)

## for researchers ##
we provide real time monocular visual slam and

(super easy to use monocular self calibration)

you may also be interested on reusing our large base of C++ code.

## for developers ##
(a large base of clean C++ code for video input, calibration, features detection, tracking, bundle adjustment, and more)

This application reuse large portions of code from:
  * [Bundler](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler)
  * [fvision2008](http://fvision2008.googlecode.com)
  * [IVT](http://ivt.sourceforge.net)
  * [libmv](http://libmv.googlecode.com)

that was modified, translated (from C/C++ style to C++ style) and organized in a large C++ code base.

We use:
  * [Boost](http://www.boost.org) and its [Generic Image Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs?view=category_Image-processing)
  * [eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)  for fast and expressive math code
